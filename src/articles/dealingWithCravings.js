    content: `Cravings can be powerful, but you have the strength to overcome them. Use these strategies:
    
    - Delay the Urge: Tell yourself to wait 10–15 minutes before acting on a craving.
    - Distract Yourself: Engage in an activity like walking, reading, or calling a friend.
    - Change Your Environment: If possible, leave the place that’s triggering the craving.
    - Use the ‘HALT’ Method: Ask yourself if you’re Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired—addressing these needs can reduce cravings.
    - Practice Deep Breathing: Slow, deep breaths help regulate emotions and decrease stress.
    - Visualize Success: Imagine yourself resisting the craving and feeling proud of your decision.
  
    Every time you successfully manage a craving, you strengthen your resilience and commitment to sobriety.`
